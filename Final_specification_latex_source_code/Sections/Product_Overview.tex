\section{Introduction}
The main aim of this project is to design a custom peripheral interfaced with the ARM microprocessor and deploy it on the Z-Board/Zybo FPGA. The peripheral is a 32 x 32 bit register having read and write access. A synthesised netlist of the custom SoC is deployed onto the FPGA and then further interfaced with the ARM core present on the zynq-7000 SoC (PS+PL) with the help of custom firmware. As a part of a test, one of the registers among the peripherals is used to send data to the LEDs present on the FPGA and another register is used to receive data from the switches on the FPGA. The design is scan-testable with the help of a TAP-controller and scan chain included to perform several test cases. The top-level system overview can be seen in the below figure.

\section{Functional Block Diagram}
The custom IP with 32x 32-bit registers is interfaced as a peripheral with the ARM Cortex-A9 core. The register file designed hereby acts as a slave and the ARM core acts as a master. Both master and slave are interfaced with the AXI4 lite bus. This bus ensures high-speed and reliable data communication between the register peripheral. The registers are RISC-V compliant hence they should be able to be used to execute any of the instructions from the RISC-V instruction set.  Hence, any firmware running on the Processing System (PS) of the SoC can use the registers on the Programmable Logic (PL) of the SoC as memory-mapped registers with the help of the AXI4 lite bus. Since this SoC will be deployed into the Zybo development board based on Zynq-7000 SoC, the LEDâ€™s and Switches present on the board can be accessed and interfaced with the help of custom register peripheral, ARM core and Custom firmware. In order to make the SoC scan testable, a TAP controller is implemented as per IEEE 1149.1 JTAG specification and interfaced with the register peripheral over a scan chain. This TAP controller receives instructions and test data from the JTAG network via standard JTAG serial pins.
